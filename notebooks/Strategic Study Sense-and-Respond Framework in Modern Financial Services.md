| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| \# | Criteria | Banks | Fintech | Comment |
| 1 | Mind-set behind strategic intent | MS | SR | Banks traditionally focus on offering standardized products to defined markets (MS), while fintechs are designed to be adaptive and customer-centric, leveraging technology for personalized services (SR). |
| 2 | Know-how | MS | SR | Banks embed know-how in production systems and processes, such as risk management systems (MS). Fintechs rely on the expertise of their people and agile processes to innovate, aligning with SR. |
| 3 | Process | MS | SR | Banks use mass production processes for standardized products like loans and accounts (MS). Fintechs offer modular and customized solutions, such as tailored investment advice, fitting SR. |
| 4 | Organizational  priority | MS | SR | Banks prioritize efficiency, risk management, and regulatory compliance, focusing on predictability (MS). Fintechs focus on rapid response to customer requests and innovation, aligning with SR. |
| 5 | Profit focus | MS | SR | Banks aim for profit margins from products and benefit from economies of scale due to their size (MS). Fintechs seek returns on investment in technology and economies of scope by offering diverse services (SR). |
| 6 | Operational concept and governance mechanism | MS | SR | Banks have functional and sequential operational structures, especially in areas like loan approval (MS). Fintechs utilize networked and parallel activities for faster decision-making, fitting SR. |
| 7 | Informational Architecture  | MS | SR | Banks often have functionally managed information systems, with siloed data for different functions (MS), though many are integrating. Fintechs typically have integrated, enterprise-wide information management (SR). |
| 8 | Informational Technology Architecture  | MS | SR | Many banks still rely on host-centric systems like mainframes (MS), while fintechs use network-centric, cloud-based architectures for agility (SR). |
| 9 | Market leader criterion | MS | SR | Banks measure success by market share in specific product categories, like deposits (MS). Fintechs aim to capture a larger share of customer spending by offering comprehensive services, aligning with SR. |
| 10 | Articulation of strategy | MS | SR | Banks develop long-term strategic plans focusing on defined products and markets (MS). Fintechs have adaptive strategies to respond quickly to market changes, fitting SR. |

The classifications were determined by evaluating each criterion against the provided definitions and considering the general tendencies of banks and fintechs. For banks, their long history and focus on standardized, regulated financial products align with the MS model, characterized by efficiency, predictability, and mass production. However, there is evidence of a shift towards SR, especially in digital banking, as seen in articles like [Sense And Respond Marketing for Bankers](https://thefinancialbrand.com/news/bank-marketing/sense-and-respond-marketing-46334), which discuss banks adopting more responsive strategies.

Fintechs, being newer and technology-driven, inherently align with SR, as they are built to be agile, customer-centric, and responsive to market changes. This is supported by observations in [Fintech \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech), noting their ability to offer innovative solutions during crises like 2020, and [World Bank Fintech](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/fintech), highlighting their role in responding to global challenges.

To address how banks should adapt to the active development of fintech, we evaluated the provided options:

1. Compete with fintech  
2. Move to other segments (e.g., mortgages)  
3. Do nothing  
4. Buy fintech companies (that have implemented successful projects on the market)  
5. Another: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Industry trends, as of April 2025, suggest that banks are facing significant pressure from fintechs, which offer innovative, customer-centric services. Analysis from sources like [Five ways banks are responding to the fintech threat](https://www.ft.com/content/d0ab6b84-c183-11e8-84cd-9e601db069b8) and [How Fintech Is Disrupting Traditional Banks in 2024](https://thefinancialbrand.com/news/fintech-banking/how-fintech-is-disrupting-traditional-banks-in-2024-175570) indicates banks are responding through acquisitions, partnerships, and digital transformation.

* **Option 1: Compete with fintech** \- This involves developing in-house innovations to match fintech offerings, which can be costly and slow given banks' legacy systems. While possible, it may not match fintechs' agility.  
* **Option 2: Move to other segments** \- Focusing on areas like mortgages might protect core business but doesn't address the broader competitive threat from fintechs across multiple services.  
* **Option 3: Do nothing** \- This is not advisable, as it risks losing market share, as seen in the growth of neobanks like Chime with 53% user growth in 2024 ([Fintech vs Banks: Rivals or Partners in Innovation](https://inoxoft.com/blog/fintech-vs-bank-can-fintech-replace-traditional-banking/)).  
* **Option 4: Buy fintech companies** \- This is a common strategy, with examples like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs acquiring fintechs to gain technology and talent. It allows rapid integration of innovations, aligning with trends in [The future of fintech growth](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/fintechs-a-new-paradigm-of-growth).  
* **Option 5: Another** \- Could include partnering with fintechs, a strategy also prevalent, as seen in banks leveraging APIs to integrate fintech services ([How are banks responding to the Fintech revolution?](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/digital-transformation/how-are-banks-responding-to-fintech/)).

Given the evidence, buying fintech companies (Option 4\) is reasonable, as it provides a direct way to acquire capabilities, supported by successful cases like BBVA's acquisition of Simple. However, partnerships could also be suggested under "Another," reflecting the collaborative trend, but since Option 4 is listed, it is selected as the primary recommendation.

#### **Conclusion**

Banks are predominantly MS, focusing on efficiency and standardized offerings, while fintechs are SR, emphasizing adaptability and customer-centric innovation. To adapt to fintech development, buying fintech companies is a strategic approach, enabling banks to integrate innovations and remain competitive in the financial landscape.
